# 📊 Month 2-Data Science

This repository contains work for **Month 2: Data Analysis and Statistical Methods**.

## Topics Covered
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Probability & Statistical Testing
3. Machine Learning (ML) Introduction
4. Model Evaluation & Tuning

## Structure
- `sales.csv` - sample dataset used across weeks
- `Week-5-EDA/` - EDA script and report
- `Week-6-Statistical_Testing/` - hypothesis testing script and report
- `Week-7-ML_Introduction/` - ML model script and summary
- `Week-8-Model_Evaluation/` - model tuning script and evaluation report

## How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Ensure Python 3.x and required packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run scripts; example:
   ```bash
   python Week-5-EDA/eda_script.py
   python Week-6-Statistical_Testing/statistical_test.py
   python Week-7-ML_Introduction/linear_regression_model.py
   python Week-8-Model_Evaluation/model_tuning.py
   ```

## Notes
- The dataset `sales.csv` is synthetic for demonstration.
- Modify scripts as needed to suit real client datasets.
